# Welcome to DialogSorter

This program/script is designed specifically to help during Dialog event at Gymjh in Prague. Feel free to use it if it could help you too!

DialogSorters takes an excel file with online form answers where people were asked to set an order of preference for different time slots and activities those slots occupied. As capacity can be limited, this script sorts people based on their desired preferences but keeps the capacity in mind. When an activity is full, a person is refused and receives a less desired option.

Or none at all. 

## Getting started / documentation

Everything about the script such as code-reference, **getting started guide**, and troubleshooting guide can be find the documentation [here](https://basileosfelices.github.io/dialogsorter/).

The docs are hosted on github pages hosted from this repository

## License

I quite like the simplicity of MIT license. You can do pretty much anything with it. If you do, please give me heads up. I'd be happy to help!
