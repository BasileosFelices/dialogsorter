# Troubleshooting

Are you having troubles? Try these steps, in case they help.

## Double check your config file.

As most of the communication between you and the program happens here. Make sure everything is present and that the headers are exact match. The search is case-sensitive I believe.

Look up [configuring config file page](setting-config.md) for help.

## I made some changes and re-run the program, nothing happened!

Make sure to close the SORTED file. If you keep the excel open, the script may have troubles saving again and overriding the data.

## Nothing here helped me, what now?

I know, this is not the most exhaustive troubleshooting guide so far. If you are interested in programming and python you can dive into the code / [code reference](reference/index.md) and try to figure out the problem yourself. If you receive any error messeges that may help you.

Maybe you can even improve my code! This is open-source software, do not hesitate to contact me / make issues at the repository.

## Could you help me?

Of course, especially if this concerns the Dialog event, but even if no. Feel free to reach out to me. I will do my best to be of help. 

You can probably find my active email address at my github profile. If you know me, you can of course try messaging me directly.:d
