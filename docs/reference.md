# Code reference

The code of dialog sorter is currently sorted into 7 files. Each constists a single class corresponding to the file name. The special case is `diaSorter.py` file which
acts both as a kind of `main()` function and an executable for starting the script.

The following reference is autogenerated from the code docstrings and describes all classes and their methods that are available. In case you want to follow the diasorter 
procedures I suggest you start by looking at `Sorter` and its `.run()` method.
